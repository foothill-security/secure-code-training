# Set Up Instructions for Labs

## ZAP
We will be using OWASP ZAP some as an intercept proxy in the labs. You will need to download and set it up.


## Git Client Setup
We will be using git/github to do some code review. You can technically do it all in the web UI, but if you want to pracice using git/gitflow, you should set up a git client. The instructions here will assume a git command-line client, but can often be translated into GUI client commands readily.

1. Check your IDE and/or command line. In your command line, type `git --version` to see if it is installed and which version. Most modern systems will have > 2.x. Most IDE's also ship with git support.
2. If not installed, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads or [on linux] use your package manager to install (e.g. `sudo apt-get install git`).

## Code Review Account
There will be snippets of code provided within this repo. Your task will be to create issues or pull requests (PRs) against those 
code snippets. You may use an existing github account or an account can be provided for you for this training in the case you do not have one, or do not wish to use your own account.

Once you have an account, review the doc on [pull requests (PRs)](pull-requests.md)
