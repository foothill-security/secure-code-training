# Overview

## Overview
This document will provide instructions on lab setup and guides for interactive labs for your secure code training. This will include both 'hacking' labs as well as code review. The code review will happen within this repository itself. Otherwise, there will be links to external apps for the 'hacking' labs.

## Lab Setup
See the [setup document](lab-setup.md) To get started on lab setup. This will include instructions on setting up your proxy app as well as how to use GitHub for [pull requests (PRs)](pull-requests.md)

## Code Review Labs
We will also do some code review. This will entail looking at a snippet of code, identifying the [security] issue with the code. You will create an issue and/or PR against that code and we will review/discuss some of the issues/PRs during the training.

## WebGoat Labs
We will 'break some stuff' to see how things can go south during the training and will use WebGoat for that (and possibly Juice Shop).  You can access WebGoat at [insert.url.here](insert.url.here)
